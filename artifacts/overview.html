                <h1>Work Term Overview</h1>
                <h3>Last updated 2025-04-19</h3>
                <p>
                    Attached below is a Gantt chart outlining my project 
                    timelines. During my work term, I was responsible for 
                    maintaining a similar Gantt chart to track my daily 
                    progress on specific tasks. My team would review every
                    co-op member's progress in weekly team meetings.

                    To summarize my work term, I was first given a brief 
                    introduction to the team's projects. I was informed that
                    the plan for me was to design the UI for one application in
                    particular. While I designed this UI on Figma, I also 
                    occasionally worked on the UI/UX design and implementation
                    for other projects using React.js. Once I had a final
                    design, I began developing the app's front end using
                    Vue.js. In the last few weeks, I have been working with the 
                    app's backend developer to connect both ends. In my final 
                    week, I will be documenting all necessary aspects of the 
                    project to ensure the next co-op student who will be taking 
                    over will have a clear understanding of the project.
