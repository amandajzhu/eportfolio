                <p>
                    While I am unable to share samples of my work,
                    this site is a demonstration of the skills I learned
                    over my work term. It was built from scratch using HTML,
                    CSS, and JavaScript, the three languages that I used the 
                    most in this role. Specifically, with Vue.js and React.js. 
                    <br/>
                    This is a GitHub page, which is a site hosted directly from
                    a GitHub repository. Using Git was incredibly important for
                    my role, as it allowed the team to work locally on the same
                    project, and tracked each developers changes. Although this
                    is an individual project, Git is helpful for tracking my 
                    own changes over time.
                    <br/>
                    While developing this site, I also used my knowledge of 
                    UI/UX design, a significant aspect of my role, as my main 
                    project involved designing an original user interface for 
                    an application. My team and I spent many meetings 
                    discussing details of the project's design before we 
                    started developing it. From these meetings I learned the 
                    importance of a clear user flow. Thus, for my eportfolio I 
                    intended to develop a clear, straightforward site that is 
                    responsive across devices.
