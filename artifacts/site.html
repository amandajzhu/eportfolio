                <h3>Last updated 2025-04-20</h3>
                <p>
                    While I am unable to share samples of my work, this site is 
                    a demonstration of the skills I learned over my work term. 
                    I followed the same development process I used in my role 
                    to successfully develop a web app: Designing the user 
                    interface on Figma, then building it with HTML, CSS, and 
                    JavaScript while using version control.
                    <br/><br/>
                    UI/UX design was a significant aspect of my role, as my 
                    main project involved designing an original user interface. 
                    My team and I spent many meetings reviewing my Figma 
                    prototypes and discussing the design before beginning to 
                    develop it. From these meetings, I learned the importance 
                    of a clear user flow. Thus, for my eportfolio, I intended 
                    to showcase my artifacts on a clear, straightforward 
                    website.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This is a GitHub page, a site hosted directly from a GitHub 
                    repository. Using Git was incredibly important for my role, 
                    as it allowed the team to work locally on the same project 
                    and track each developer's changes. Although this is an 
                    individual project, Git helps me track my changes over 
                    time.
