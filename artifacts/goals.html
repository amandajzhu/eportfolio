                    Attached below is my Work Term Goal Setting & Tracking 
                    charts from Week 5 of my work term. These goals were set on
                    February 5, 2025 by my supervisor and I in alignment with 
                    my responsibilities
                    in this role.

                    As I approach the end of my work term, I can confidently
                    say that all of these goals were fulfilled.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Teamwork & Communication:</b> I actively
                    communicated with my team to overcome any obstacles that
                    arose, resulting in a timely completion of features.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Interpersonal:</b> I consistently delivered coherent and 
                    concise presentations at weekly team meetings, making sure
                    to clearly communicate all important information. As a 
                    result, the team was able to have informed disucssions on 
                    my projects.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Job Skill: </b> After working on several features using 
                    React in collaboration with experienced developers, I know 
                    have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of React.
