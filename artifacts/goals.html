                    Attached below are my Work Term Goal Setting & Tracking 
                    charts from Week 5 of my work term. These goals were set on
                    February 5, 2025, by my supervisor and I in alignment with 
                    my responsibilities in this role.

                    As I approach the end of my work term, I can confidently
                    say that all of these goals were fulfilled.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Teamwork & Communication:</b> I actively
                    communicated with my team to overcome any obstacles that
                    arose, resulting in a timely completion of features, 
                    adhering to our timelines.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Interpersonal:</b> I consistently delivered coherent and 
                    concise presentations at weekly team meetings, making sure
                    to clearly communicate all important information. Thus, the 
                    team was able to have informed discussions on my projects 
                    at each meeting, leading to a productive week ahead.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Job Skill: </b> After working on several features using 
                    React in collaboration with experienced developers, I now 
                    have a solid grasp of its fundamentals. As a result, I can 
                    have a clear approach to my tasks involving React.
